# Official Code for MIRROR (NDSS 2022)

This is the PyTorch implementation for NDSS 2022 paper "MIRROR: Model Inversion for Deep Learning Network with High Fidelity". For more inversion results, please refer to [mirror github page](https://model-inversion.github.io/mirror/).

Note: we only uploaded the scripts and cache files for resnet50 and vgg16 model. Others will be updated soon.

## Environment

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mirror
```

## Usage

### 1. Download cache files

```
python my_download_cache.py
```

### 2. White-box invert ResNet50

Conduct the inversion.

```
zsh scripts/run_vggface2_resnet50_whitebox.sh

```

Test the inversion.

```
zsh scripts/run_vggface2_resnet50_whitebox_test.sh
```

### 3. Black-box invert ResNet50

Conduct the inversion.

```
zsh scripts/run_vggface2_resnet50_blackbox.sh

```

Test the inversion.

```
zsh scripts/run_vggface2_resnet50_blackbox_test.sh
```

## Build cache files

We need to first generate styelgan's images if we haven't done it.

```
python my_sample_z_w_space.py
```

Use inception_resnetv1_vggface2 as an example. We first generate the outputs of the network on the stylegan's samples. Then we merge them into one file.

```
python my_generate_blackbox_attack_dataset.py --arch_name inception_resnetv1_vggface2 stylegan
python my_merge_all_tensors.py blackbox_attack_data/stylegan/inception_resnetv1_vggface2/no_dropout --remove
```
